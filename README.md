# NetworkRail_UKHab
This is a jupyter notebook to generate annual outputs supporting Network Rail's biodiversity management.

You need to create a conda environment to run the notebook. If you are using a windows x64 platform you need to type the following in a conda console: conda create --name --file network_rail.txt, where env is the name you choose for the environment (suggestion: network_rail)

Or use the yml file for any platform (not yet tested, 05/09/2023). conda env create -f network_rail.yml
